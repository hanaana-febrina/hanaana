        <h2>Oxford researchers propose ‘Carbon Removal Budget’ to tackle climate change</h2>
        <p>Dr Ben Caldecott, the Lombard Odier Associate Professor at the University of Oxford Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and lead author said, 'Carbon removal is the ‘net’ in ‘net zero’ and it is mission critical for tackling climate change. However, carbon removal is not in infinite supply and is certainly not free to produce.'

            To limit global warming we need to level off the cumulative stock of carbon in the atmosphere and achieve the state of ‘net zero’, when all emissions that can be eliminated are, and any residual emissions are neutralised by durably removing carbon from the atmosphere.
            
            Traditional carbon removal methods like planting trees and restoring wetlands are part of this mix, as are more novel options like biochar and technologies that directly capture and store carbon. The availability of carbon removal is, however, constrained. For example, some carbon removal methods depend on significant energy consumption and require vast tracts of land.</p>
